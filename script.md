```You``` Hi Rinni, pleasant to meet you.  
```Rinni.smiling``` Well, this is a rather exquisite auction here. You must be an important person.  
```You``` Yeah, I guess so. I've known the host for many years now.  
```Rinni.shocked``` Oh is that so? Well, I just touched down from Paris.  
```Rinni.smiling``` I believe the other bidders are also from various countries. Hmm, I wonder what professions are they from such that they want the item. <sub>[Highlights that the characters should not know each others' occupations]</sub>
